## üìö Key Learnings

### **Technical Insights**

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
   - No need for complex authentication initially
   - Simple file-based configuration works well

2. **TypeScript Benefits**
   - Caught many errors during development
   - Better IDE support and autocomplete

3. **Docker Simplification**
   - Single `docker-compose up` command for full stack
   - Consistent environment across development and production
   - Easy to share and deploy

4. **Email Integration Challenges**
   - Gmail requires app passwords (not regular passwords)
   - SMTP configuration needs proper error handling
   - HTML email templates improve user experience

### **Development Process Learnings**

   - Removed unnecessary dependencies (Redux, Material-UI)
   - Focused on core functionality first

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Manual testing with curl commands proved effective
   - GitHub Actions provided real-world testing scenarios
   - Email testing required careful configuration

### **Architecture Decisions**

2. **Frontend Framework**: React with hooks over complex state management
3. **Styling**: CSS Grid/Flexbox over component libraries
4. **Containerization**: Docker Compose for easy deployment
5. **Email Service**: Nodemailer with SMTP over third-party services

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Email Not Working**
 ```bash
   # Verify Gmail app password is correct
   # Check spam folder for test emails
   ```
2. **Frontend Not Loading**
   ```bash
   # Check if backend is running
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   
   # Verify frontend is built
   ls frontend/dist/
   ```

### **Debugging Commands**

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/metrics
curl http://localhost:3001/api/pipelines
```

## üöÄ Deployment

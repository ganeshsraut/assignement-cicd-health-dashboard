User: Suppose you are Developer,
 I have a GitHub repo build a CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard to monitor executions from tools like GitHub Actions. 
The dashboard should- 
1)Collect data on pipeline executions (success/failure, build time, status). 
2)Show real-time metrics: . Success/Failure rate . Average build time . Last build status 
3)Send alerts Email on pipeline failures. Â·
4)Provide a simple frontend UI to Visualize pipeline metrics and display logs/status of latest builds.
5)The application should be containerized.
6)Application will be deployed on local don't assume any cloud platform.
And suggest me what more we can add on it. 
Suggest what tools we should use for frontend, backend and database. 
NOTE: Don't generate the code until I say.
